### ChessAI

A simple browser-based Chess AI that employs Minimax with alpha-beta pruning.

Currently the evaluation function is quite weak and anywhere from 1000-2000 states are explored per second, which is quite suboptimal (Some moves take almost a full minute to make, your browser might try to convince you that the webpage is no longer responding).

I plan on adding [Transposition Tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_table "Wikipedia") sometime in the future to make playing against it a bit more bearable.
