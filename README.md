### ChessAI

A simple browser-based Chess AI that employs Minimax with alpha-beta pruning.

Currently the evaluation function is quite weak and anywhere from 1000-2000 states are explored per second, which is quite suboptimal.

The addition of [Transposition Tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_table "Wikipedia") would make this project a bit more bearable.
